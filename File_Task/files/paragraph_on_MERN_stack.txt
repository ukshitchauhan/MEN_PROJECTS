The MERN stack is a powerful full-stack development framework that uses MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to build modern, high-performance web applications. It allows developers to work entirely with JavaScript, both on the frontend and backend, making the development process faster and more efficient. MongoDB handles the database layer with flexible document storage, while Express and Node manage server-side logic, APIs, and authentication. React powers the user interface with reusable components and smooth, dynamic rendering. Together, the MERN stack provides an end-to-end solution for creating scalable, responsive, and production-ready web applications.
